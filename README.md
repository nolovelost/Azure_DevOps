This was a project I was involved in as a lead programmer. The project was meant to be used as a drawing game, sent to mailing lists by Abertay University's marketing team as part of their marketing campaign.

The game follows a prospective student, drawn by the player, across his/her journey in Dundee. It was meant as a lighthearted campaign to highlight the city's attractions including V&A, Discovery Ship, McManus Museum, Ice Rink, Penguins, etc.

The project was made completely in Unity and was meant to be exported as an HTML5 project, however, due to working for little less than 2 weeks and having little time for optimizations, it wasn't possible to settle for WebGL, rather a Windows build was created.

- [WFC + Behaviour AI](https://pratyushbsingh.visualstudio.com/WFC_BehaviourAI)

A solo project carried out during my study at Abertay University. The purpose was to check if the WFC algorithm created by Maxim Gumin could be used to design AI behaviour and replicate them across generations to create different but consistent behaviours.

- [Maze Shooter](https://pratyushbsingh.visualstudio.com/Maze_Shooter)

A 3D maze shooter prototype put together as part of my study at MProf in less than 5 days. All assets are taken from Unreal's standard assets except for the player's ship which was a simple model created in Maya. All shaders/materials are modifications of existing Unreal materials. Game is all coded within C++ with minor scripting in Blueprints.

- [CryProject](https://pratyushbsingh.visualstudio.com/CryProject)

CryEngine project in constant upheaval. Functions as an ongoing personal project.

____________

- [Sebastien](https://pratyushbsingh.visualstudio.com/Sebastien)

The intent of the project is to completely implement a believable Animation AI for a detailed game character. This endeavour shall require me to cleanup the rig, remove certain parts from the model itself, convert to an IK rig, retarget animations and finally to use the IK to its rational extent. The model is Sebastien from Unityâ€™s short ADAM.

____________

- [Concrete](https://pratyushbsingh.visualstudio.com/Concrete)

This is a simple building structure that has been modularised after being put together. It is in-progress and has a good foundation to build upon except for a little clean up that each modular windows needs due to a them being directly detached from the complete piece rather than the other way around.
