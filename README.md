This was a project I was involved in as a lead programmer. The project was meant to be used as a drawing game, sent to mailing lists by Abertay University's marketing team as part of their marketing campaign.

The game follows a prospective student, drawn by the player, across his/her journey in Dundee. It was meant as a lighthearted campaign to highlight the city's attractions including V&A, Discovery Ship, McManus Museum, Ice Rink, Penguins, etc.

The project was made completely in Unity and was meant to be exported as an HTML5 project, however, due to working for little less than 2 weeks and having little time for optimizations, it wasn't possible to settle for WebGL, rather a Windows build was created.
